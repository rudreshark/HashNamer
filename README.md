```

**The ultimate CTF multi‑tool:** automatically identify and decode dozens of encoding formats, detect hash types, crack weak passwords using built‑in and system wordlists, and check cracked passwords against the *Have I Been Pwned* database – all with zero user interaction (fully automatic mode).

---

## Features

- 🔍 **46 Detection & Decoding Methods** – BaseXX, Hex, Binary, ROT13/47, Atbash, Caesar, Affine, Vigenère, Rail Fence, Morse, Bacon, NATO, Polybius, A1Z26, T9, Leetspeak, URL‑encode, HTML entities, XOR brute‑force and more.
- 🧠 **Automatic Chaining** – The engine recursively decodes the output until it reaches plain text (or gives up gracefully).
- 🗝️ **Hash Identifier** – Detects 30+ hash types (MD5, SHA1/2/3, NTLM, bcrypt, Argon2, WordPress, Django, etc.).
- 🚀 **Instant Cracking** – No more prompts! Upon hash detection, the tool immediately tries the built‑in wordlist (~130 passwords), then falls back to any system wordlist (rockyou.txt, etc.) it finds automatically.
- 📡 **HIBP Integration** – If a password is cracked, it queries the *Have I Been Pwned* API (k‑anonymity, privacy‑safe) and tells you how many breaches that password has been seen in.
- 🧩 **Multi‑Line Input** – Paste large hex dumps or multi‑line data; the tool handles it.
- 🎨 **Colourful Console** – Uses `colorama` for a beautiful, easy‑to‑read interface.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudreshark/hashnamer.git
cd hashnamer
```

### 2. Install the only external dependency
```bash
pip install colorama   # optional, but recommended for coloured output
```

> **Note:** The tool is written in pure Python 3 and uses only standard libraries except `colorama`. If you don't install it, the tool still works – just without colours.

### 3. (Optional) Install John the Ripper & Hashcat
If you want to use the more advanced cracking engines (not required – the built‑in and system wordlist methods work out of the box):
```bash
sudo apt install john hashcat   # on Debian/Ubuntu
```

---

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python3 hashnamer.py
```

You will see a banner and then the interactive prompt:
```
INPUT >
```

Paste any encoded string, hash, ciphertext, or hex dump and press Enter.

### How it works (fully automatic)
1. **Encoding detection** – The tool scans the input against dozens of regular expressions.
2. **Auto‑chaining** – It decodes the input, then re‑scans the result, repeating until no more known patterns are found.
3. **Hash identification** – If the input (or any decoded step) matches a hash signature, it is flagged.
4. **Cracking** – For crackable hashes (MD5, SHA1, NTLM, etc.), the tool instantly:
   - Tries the built‑in wordlist.
   - If not found, scans any system wordlist it finds (rockyou.txt, etc.).
   - Reports the plaintext password and automatically checks it against HIBP.
5. **Final output** – The last decodable / cracked value is shown.

## Examples

### 1. Base64 → Hex → Flag
```
INPUT > 666c61677b346e645f30683372357d
```
Output:
```
[STEP 1] Method  : Hex Raw          [█████████▌] 95%
         Result  : flag{4nd_0h3r5}
[FINAL DECODED OUTPUT]
flag{4nd_0h3r5}
```

### 2. Crack an MD5 hash
```
INPUT > e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
```
Output:
```
╔══ HASH IDENTIFIED ══╗
  Type    : MD5
  Value   : e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
  Hashcat : -m 0
[*] Attempting automatic cracking...

```

### 3. Multi‑step ROT13 → Base64 → Text
```
INPUT > Uryyb Jbeyq   (ROT13 of "Hello World")
```
Output:
```
[STEP 1] Method  : ROT13            [████████] 85%
         Result  : Hello World
[FINAL DECODED OUTPUT]

## HIBP (Have I Been Pwned) Integration

When a password is cracked, the tool automatically queries the **Have I Been Pwned** API using the k‑anonymity model:
- It sends only the first 5 characters of the SHA‑1 hash.
- The API returns a list of matching hash suffixes and their breach counts.
- Your password **never leaves your machine** in plain text.

If the password is found, you'll see something like:
```
[HIBP] Found in 15,234,567 breach(es) — compromised!
```

---

## Wordlist Management

The tool automatically scans common system paths for wordlists:
- `/usr/share/wordlists`
- `/usr/share/dict`
- `/usr/share/seclists`
- `/opt/wordlists`

It prioritises `rockyou.txt` (uncompressed) if found. The built‑in list (~130 entries) is always tried first and is enough for most CTF passwords.
